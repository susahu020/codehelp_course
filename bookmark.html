      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Linus Torvalds is a Finnish-American software engineer who is the
        creator and principal developer of the Linux kernel, which is the kernel
        for a number of operating systems. He also created the version control
        system Git. Torvalds was born on December 28, 1969 in Helsinki, Finland.
        He studied computer science at the University of Helsinki, and he
        developed the Linux kernel as a student project in 1991. Since then, the
        Linux kernel has become one of the most widely used kernels in the
